This project is an interactive game where users get to explore a list of delectable foods, pick their favorite, and engage in a series of yes-or-no questions to guess the chosen item. It's a delightful journey through questions tailored to unveil the mystery behind your selected food!

## How It Works

2. **Navigate the Questions:** Engage in a fun-filled session answering yes or no queries.
3. **Discover Your Food:** Based on your responses, uncover the food you've been craving!
